#Description as a Tweet
Not sure which dorm to choose for this semester? Having troubles with your current roommate? Want to find a new roommate or a new place to live? Look no further, RoomMass is here for you!!! RoomMass is a website where you can find your desired roommate or a person who wants to swap rooms with you!

#Inspiration
Last year, a teammate of ours was matched with an incompatible roommate at the start of the Fall semester. Even worse, they did not know where to move to and had a hard time finding a new suitable roommate. Since then, our teammate has been nurturing an idea to help those who are having similar problems. This website will help lessen the stress and anxiety caused by the ongoing UMass’s housing problems. 

#What It Does
Have trouble with your current roommate? RoomMass provides ease of finding a new roommate or a new dorm room. 
Connect to other students and find the most suitable roommate, based on their major, hobbies, similar course taking, etc.

#Technologies We Used
React.js, Node.js, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Visual Studio Code (text editor).

#Challenges We Ran Into
This is our first time taking part in a hackathon and none of us has strong familiarity in web development, so we had many struggles to transform the idea into code. 
We also struggled to come up with a unique idea without it being totally impractical.

#What We Have Learned
We learned how to devise a working solution to a real-world problem and assign tasks to our teammates based on our strengths and weaknesses. 
We learned how to push ourselves despite the lack of sleep and technical knowledge.
Time management, as we had very little time to plan, develop, and test our project. We also had to come up with a documentation to present our product, which is as important as the project itself.

#What’s Next
There are some ideas we have yet to implement given the time constraint, including but not limited to:
Employ closure data hiding techniques to circumvent JavaScript’s lack of encapsulation.
Store data on online server instead of local server
Display relevant data such as the nearest locations on campus relative to the dorm being reviewed, e.g., the closest dining hall, library, and gym.
